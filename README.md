A bar plot showing the ratio of positive Covid-19 cases vs tests for the top 10 countries with the highest overall cases.

## About

The COVID19 Worldwide Testing Data dataset found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/lin0li/covid19testing) and contains data that was collected between 1/20/2020 and 6/1/2020. Covid-19 trends were investigated in R.

**Goals:**
1. Determine the top 10 countries with the highest Covid-19 cases.
2. Calculate the ratio of postive cases vs tests for each country and determine the 3 countries with the highest ratio.

## Future work
1. Recalculate using the most up-to-date Covid-19 data.

## Requirements
This code was developed using R 4.0.5.
